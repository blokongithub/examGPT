1) Describe the process of photosynthesis, including the light-dependent and light-independent reactions, and the factors that can affect its rate. (10 marks)  
- 2 marks for describing the overall equation of photosynthesis (6CO2 + 6H2O â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2)  
- 3 marks for explaining light-dependent reactions: production of ATP and NADPH in thylakoids, photolysis of water, release of oxygen  
- 3 marks for explaining light-independent reactions (Calvin Cycle): use of ATP and NADPH to convert CO2 into glucose in the stroma  
- 1 mark for mentioning factors affecting rate (e.g., light intensity, CO2 concentration, temperature)  

2) Explain the role of enzymes in biological processes, including how factors such as temperature and pH can influence enzyme activity. (10 marks)  
- 2 marks for defining enzymes as biological catalysts and their role in lowering activation energy  
- 2 marks for explaining the mechanism of enzyme action (e.g., active site, substrate specificity, lock and key model or induced fit model)  
- 3 marks for discussing factors affecting enzyme activity:   
  - 1 mark for temperature effects (increased activity up to an optimum, followed by denaturation)  
  - 1 mark for pH effects (optimal range varies, changes can lead to denaturation or ionization of active site)  
- 3 marks for providing examples of enzymes in biological processes (e.g., catalase, amylase, lactase)  

3) Discuss the significance of genetic variation in a population and the mechanisms that can lead to genetic diversity. (10 marks)  
- 2 marks for defining genetic variation and its importance for adaptation and evolution  
- 3 marks for explaining mechanisms that create genetic variation:  
  - 1 mark for mutation (source of new alleles)  
  - 1 mark for sexual reproduction (crossing over and independent assortment)  
  - 1 mark for gene flow (migration between populations)  
- 3 marks for discussing the significance of genetic diversity:  
  - 1 mark for resilience to environmental changes  
  - 1 mark for survival of species (natural selection)  
  - 1 mark for reduced inbreeding depression and increased population viability  
- 2 marks for providing relevant examples (e.g., effect on populations of plants/animals, importance in conservation)
